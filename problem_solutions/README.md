The starting """... """ docstring contains my thoughts going into the 
problem

The # x[number] contains comments where I made an error and resolved it in 
the code. These comments are ordered by their number.

Attaching a # * to a comment means that the sentence is not finished. All 
connected parts of the sentence will have a # * behind them.
