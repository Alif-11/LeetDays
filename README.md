# Leet Days

## Current Streak
2nd day (Good, good)

## Purpose
This repo will serve to hold my solutions to a daily LeetCode question I complete. This repo will similar function to Duolingo, where I complete an activity a day. I hope to build up a streak.

## Motivation
I have found it hard to be consistent with my LeetCode practice, since they don't have the aggressive gratification features Duolingo has, with their reminder messages telling you to maintain your streak. So, this repo will not only hold all of my solutions to LeetCode questions going forward, but will also have a streak counter in the README. I'll give myself rewarding messages and reminders to help keep my streak up.
