# Leet Days

## Current Streak
2 (Tough problem, nice work beating it!)

## Purpose
This repo will serve to hold my solutions to a daily LeetCode question I complete. This repo will similar function to Duolingo, where I complete an activity a day. I hope to build up a streak.

## Motivation
I have found it hard to be consistent with my LeetCode practice, as there is no gratification feature like Duolingo has, with there streaks, their reminder messages, etc. So, this repo will not only hold all of my solutions to LeetCode questions going forward, but will also have a streak counter in the README. I'll give myself rewarding messages and reminders to help keep my streak up.
